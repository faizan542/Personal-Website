                </div>
                <div class="explain">
                    <p class="para">Though it has had a rough past, the present and future of Swat Valley are shining
                        very
                        bright. This stunning valley in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan is something
                        straight
                        out of a fairy tale.</p><br><br>
                    <p class="para">Think bright green fields and forests, picturesque villages, and rivers boasting
                        shades
                        of blue so clear and bright you wouldn’t have thought them real!</p><br><br>
                    <p class="para">The true beauty of Swat can be found around the town of Kalam, which serves as a
                        base to
                        the explore the beauty of the valley. Here are 3 places you can’t miss in Swat Valley:</p><br>
                </div>
                <h1>Boyun Village</h1>
                <div class="images">
                    <img src="gallery2.jpg" alt="Boyun Village">
                </div>
                <div class="explain">
                    <p class="para">Boyun, also known as Green Top, is a short drive or manageable up-hill walk from
                        Kalam
                        town. When you finally reached the pinnacle, you’ll be rewarded with a panorama of one of the
                        most
                        vast and beautiful villages I’ve ever seen – along with sweeping views of the valley below.
                        Boyun is
                        an easy day trip from Kalam.</p><br>
                </div>
                <h1>Kandol and Spindhor Lakes</h1>
                <div class="images">
                    <img src="gallery3.jpg" alt="Kandol and Spindhor Lakes">
                </div>
                <div class="explain">
                    <p class="para">These alpine lakes lie 2 hours away from Kalam. These days, Kandol Lake is
                        accessible via jeep track and is a bit more commercialised, whereas Spindhor can only be reached
                        on a 2-hour trek. Whichever you choose to visit, both are absolutely counted among the most
                        beautiful places in Pakistan.</p><br>
                </div>
                <h1>Ushu Forest</h1>
                <div class="images">
                    <img src="gallery4.jpg" alt="Ushu Forest">
                </div>
                <div class="explain">
                    <p class="para">This well-preserved forest is full of deodar trees and is a fabulous place to get
                        lost. The road that leads into the forest continues on to several villages set along the Kalam
                        River.</p><br>
                </div>
                <h1>2. Hunza Valley</h1>
                <div class="images">
                    <img src="gallery5.jpg" alt="Hunza Valley">
                </div>
                <div class="explain">
                    <p class="para">If you live in Pakistan – or have read anything about the country – it’s almost
                        certain you’ve come across the name Hunza. Don’t let the word ‘valley’ confuse you, though –
                        Hunza is actually a massive district made up of numerous valleys and villages. One part of the
                        ancient Silk Road, here are some of the most beautiful sights in Hunza:</p><br>
                </div>
                <h1>Passu Cones</h1>
                <div class="images">
                    <img src="gallery6.jpg" alt="Passu Cones">
                </div>
                <div class="explain">
                    <p class="para">The Passu Cathedral is a natural work of art and one of the most recognisable scenes
                        in Pakistan. Though staying overnight in Passu village is no longer allowed, the cones are
                        visible from a ways away, starting from the village of Gulmit. The most iconic view of the
                        Cathedral is from the Karakoram Highway, about an hour’s drive from Gilgit City.</p><br>
                </div>
                <h1>Attabad Lake</h1>
                <div class="images">
                    <img src="gallery7.jpg" alt="Attabad Lake">
                </div>
                <div class="explain">
                    <p class="para">A lake that doesn’t look real… Even when you’re standing right in front of it.
                        Attabad was born out of tragedy when a massive landslide occurred in 2010. The flow of the Hunza
                        River was blocked, and the now-famous lake was created in its wake. Its bright-blue turquoise
                        waters make the it one of the most beautiful places in Pakistan.</p><br>
                </div>
                <h1>Eagle’s Nest</h1>
                <div class="images">
                    <img src="gallery8.jpg" alt="Eagle’s Nest">
                </div>
                <div class="explain">
                    <p class="para">Want to see one of the most epic sunsets in the Hunza Valley? Head to Eagle’s Nest
                        around golden hour! The name comes from an upscale hotel/restaurant nearby, but you can drive up
                        to the viewpoint without going there.</p><br>
                </div>
                <h1>3. Yarkhun Valley</h1>
                <div class="images">
                    <img src="gallery9.jpg" alt="Yarkhun Valley">
                </div>
                <div class="explain">
                    <p class="para">
                        Though it’s relatively unheard of and forgotten compared to Pakistan’s most famous tourist
                        spots, I think Yarkhun Valley was the most beautiful place I visited in the country. Located in
                        the Upper Chitral district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Yarkhun dazzles with its mountain ranges and
                        untouched villages.</p><br><br>
                    <p class="para">Reaching the valley, which stretches for many kilometres past the administrative
                        town of Mastuj, requires a bit of effort if you don’t have your own vehicle. If you do have one
                        though, the ride isn’t too bad – just prepare for mostly dirt roads!</p><br><br>
                    <p class="para">The side valley of Gazin is most definitely worth a detour if you make it all the
                        way to Yarkhun. Here, you can see the mountains of the Thoi Pass, a high-altitude pass that
                        connects Upper Chitral with Yasin Valley in Gilgit Baltistan.</p><br>
                </div>
                <h1>4. Broghil Valley</h1>
                <div class="images">
                    <img src="gallery10.jpg" alt="Broghil Valley">
                </div>
                <div class="explain">
                    <p class="para">Located way up north very close to Afghanistan’s Wakhan Corridor, Broghil Valley was
                        formerly only accessible via trek or horseback. These days, the once-hidden locale can be
                        reached by
                        a treacherous jeep track – yet it still only receives a handful of visitors during the few
                        months
                        it’s not frozen under heaps of snow.</p><br><br>
                    <p class="para">Currently, whether or not foreigners are allowed to visit Broghil is iffy. (If
                        you’re
                        insistent, make sure you check with the Deputy Commissioner’s Office in Chitral before making
                        the
                        trek up there.) But Pakistanis – please go see this beauty! The valley is home to numerous
                        high-altitude lakes, yaks, and sprawling green pastures, all set against a dramatic mountainous
                        backdrop that soars above 13,000 feet.</p><br><br>
                    <p class="para">Moreover, a day’s trek from Lashkargaz, the last village in Broghil, will lead you
                        to
                        Karambar Lake, one of the highest in the world!</p><br>
                </div>
                <h1>5. Deosai Plains National Park</h1>
                <div class="images">
                    <img src="gallery11.jpg" alt="Deosai Plains National Park">
                </div>
                <div class="explain">
                    <p class="para">
                        Deosai is often referred to as the roof of the world. And it kinda is. At 4,117 metres (13,497
                        feet), the massive plateau is the second-highest on the planet, and is only really accessible
                        during summer.</p><br><br>
                    <p class="para">Sprawling emerald-green meadows, snow-capped peaks and glistening blue lakes greet
                        visitors who make the journey to this beautiful spot. The Himalayan Brown Bear calls Deosai its
                        home and has been spotted by many a visitor – watch out for them if you’re camping!</p><br>
