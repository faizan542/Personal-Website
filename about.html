                        Republic of Pakistan</strong>, is a country in South Asia. It is the
                    world's fifth-most populous country with a population exceeding 212.2 million. It has the world's
                    second-largest Muslim population. It is the 33rd-largest country by area, spanning 881,913 square
                    kilometres (340,509 square miles). Pakistan has a 1,046-kilometre (650-mile) coastline along the
                    Arabian
                    Sea and Gulf of Oman in the south and is bordered by India to the east, Afghanistan to the west,
                    Iran to
                    the southwest, and China to the northeast. It is separated narrowly from Tajikistan by Afghanistan's
                    Wakhan Corridor in the northwest, and also shares a maritime border with Oman.</p>

                    the site of several ancient cultures and intertwined
                    with the history of the broader Indian subcontinent. The ancient history involves the Neolithic site
                    of Mehrgarh and the Bronze Age Indus Valley Civilisation, and was later home to kingdoms ruled by
                    people of different faiths and cultures, including Hindus, Indo-Greeks, Muslims, Turco-Mongols,
                    Afghans and Sikhs. The area has been ruled by numerous empires and dynasties, including the Persian
                    Achaemenid Empire, Alexander III of Macedon's empire, the Seleucid Empire, the Indian Maurya Empire,
                    the Kushan Empire, the Gupta Empire, the Arab Umayyad Caliphate, the Ghaznavids Empire, the

                <p class="para">Pakistan gained independence in 1947 as a
                    homeland for Indian Muslims following the Pakistan Movement, which sought statehood for the
                    Muslim-majority regions of British India through partition. It is an ethnically and
                    linguistically diverse country, with similarly diverse geography and wildlife. Initially a dominion,
                    Pakistan adopted a constitution in 1956, becoming an Islamic republic. An ethnic civil war and
                    Indian military intervention in 1971 resulted in the secession of East Pakistan as the new country
                    of Bangladesh. In 1973, Pakistan adopted a new constitution which stipulated that all laws are
                    to conform to the injunctions of Islam as laid down in the Quran and Sunnah. In 2008, Pakistan
                    transitioned to civilian rule. In 2010, Pakistan adopted a parliamentary system with periodic
                    elections.</p></div>

                    It is ranked among the emerging and growth-leading economies of the world, and is backed by
                    one of the world's largest and fastest-growing middle class populations. Pakistan's
                    political history since independence has been characterized by periods of military rule, political
                    instability, and conflicts with India. The country continues to face challenges including poverty,
                    illiteracy, and corruption. Pakistan is a member of the UN, the Shanghai Cooperation
                    Organisation, the OIC, the Commonwealth of Nations, the SAARC, the Islamic Military Counter
                    Terrorism Coalition, and is a major non-NATO ally.</p></div>

                <p class="para">Pakistan is the only country to have been created
                    in the name of Islam. The idea of Pakistan, which had received overwhelming popular support
                    among Indian Muslims, especially those in the provinces of British India where Muslims were in a
                    minority such as the United Provinces, was articulated in terms of an Islamic state by the
                    Muslim League leadership, the ulama (Islamic clergy) and Jinnah. Jinnah had developed a close
                    association with the ulama and upon his death was described by one such alim, Maulana Shabbir Ahmad
                    Usmani, as the greatest Muslim after Aurangzeb and as someone who desired to unite the Muslims of
                    the world under the banner of Islam.</p></div>

                <p class="para">The Objectives Resolution in March 1949, which
                    declared God as the sole sovereign over the entire universe, represented the first formal step to
                    transform Pakistan into an Islamic state. Muslim League leader Chaudhry Khaliquzzaman
                    asserted that Pakistan could only truly become an Islamic state after bringing all believers of
                    Islam into a single political unit. Keith Callard, one of the earliest scholars on Pakistani
                    politics, observed that Pakistanis believed in the essential unity of purpose and outlook in the
                    Muslim world and assumed that Muslim from other countries would share their views on the
                    relationship between religion and nationality.</p></div>

                <p class="para">However, Pakistan's pan-Islamist sentiments for a
                    united Islamic bloc called Islamistan were not shared by other Muslim governments, although
                    Islamists such as the Grand Mufti of Palestine, Al-Haj Amin al-Husseini, and leaders of the Muslim
                    Brotherhood, became drawn to the country. Pakistan's desire for an international organization of
                    Muslim countries was fulfilled in the 1970s when the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) was
                    formed.</p></div>
